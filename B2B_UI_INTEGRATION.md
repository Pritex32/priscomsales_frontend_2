// Inside your Routes
<Route path="/b2b-movement" element={<B2BStockMovement />} />
```

### 2. **Add Navigation Menu Item**

Add a menu item in your sidebar/navigation:

```jsx
<Link to="/b2b-movement">
  <ArrowRightLeft className="w-5 h-5" />
  <span>Stock Movement</span>
</Link>
```

### 3. **Verify Dependencies**

All required packages are already in your `package.json`:
- ‚úÖ `react` - ^18.2.0

- ‚úÖ `react-toastify` - ^11.0.5

### 4. **Ensure Toast Container in App.js**

Make sure `ToastContainer` is rendered at the root level:

```javascript
import { ToastContainer } from 'react-toastify';
import 'react-toastify/dist/ReactToastify.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <Routes>
        {/* Your routes */}
      </Routes>
      <ToastContainer 
        position="top-right"
        autoClose={3000}
        hideProgressBar={false}
        newestOnTop
        closeOnClick
        rtl={false}
        pauseOnFocusLoss
        draggable
        pauseOnHover
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

## Styling

The component uses:
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **Lucide React** for modern icons
- **Custom color schemes**:
  - Blue (#3B82F6) for warehouse transfers
  - Green (#10B981) for customer sales
  - Red (#EF4444) for stockouts
- **Rounded corners** and **subtle shadows**
- **Hover effects** for better UX

## Best Practices

1. **Always show stock levels** - Dropdown displays current stock
2. **Color consistency** - Each transfer type has its own color
3. **Clear error messages** - Descriptive toast notifications
4. **Auto-refresh** - Movements reload after each action
5. **Responsive design** - Mobile-friendly layout
6. **Accessibility** - Proper labels and ARIA attributes

## Keyboard Shortcuts (Future Enhancement)

Consider adding:
- `Ctrl+1` - Switch to Warehouse Transfer
- `Ctrl+2` - Switch to Customer Sale
- `Ctrl+3` - Switch to Stockout
- `Ctrl+E` - Export CSV
- `Ctrl+S` - Submit form

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Filters work correctly
- [ ] CSV export downloads properly

## Troubleshooting

### Icons not showing

### Styling issues
Make sure Tailwind is configured in `tailwind.config.js` and CSS is imported in `index.css`:
```css

@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```
